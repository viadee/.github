## ABOUT viadeeðŸ‘‹

viadee Unternehmensberatung AG is a German IT company with more than 200 employees including our interns. Our company culture is dedicated to caring for each one individually, maximizing our potential. Applying this principle, we have come a long way since 1994 to offer great individual solutions to our customers.

viadee currently has an office in MÃ¼nster, as well as offices in Cologne and Dortmund. We focus on a regional customer base in North Rhine-Westphalia. Projects are seldom far away from our employees' home location, which allows us to proudly say that most of our consultants have the chance to sleep at home. This contributes to our flexibility, family lives as well as to our CO2 footprints.

The industry sectors in which our consultants are active include banking, electric power industry, trade, IT and service companies, logistics, public service, telecommunications, insurers, and supply plants.

We emphasize knowledge exchange and hence established the [NAVIGATE](https://navigate-kongress.de) online conference (German) for this purpose. In 2022 it includes a number of [NAVIGATE Masterclasses](https://navigate-kongress.de/masterclasses/), that are often hands-on excerpts from our [seminar program](https://www.viadee.de/seminare).

## TOPICS OF INTEREST
We share a passion for technological and methodical expertise. Keeping up to date with the ever-changing world of IT, there are various opportunities to grow within viadee. 

Bringing BPMN (business process model and notation) models to life is currently one of 
our core activities. Prominent mention should be given to our Open Source contributions on GitHub, as well as our [Confluence BPMN-Modeler](https://www.viadee.de/en/solutions/business-process-management/bpmn-modeler) on the Atlassian Marketplace. Work often is organized in agile projects leveraging Java- or Cloud-based technologies, be it new technologies like Quarkus and Micronaut or Spring Boot, or established practices like WSDL or [REST](https://www.viadee.de/seminar/rest/). Java and SAS have accompanied us through almost all our company history and with most customers. However, we emphasize our undogmatic view on technologies and methods and use whatever is appropriate, such as Python and R in the [Data Science](https://www.viadee.de/data-science/) Domain. 
To keep up with the scientific discussion we enjoy cooperation, both with ERCIS, and other research institutions.

Test automation is great to ensure software quality. We feel it is even greater with a tool developed here called [Mateo](https://www.viadee.de/loesungen/testautomatisierung/mateo-core), the viadee test automation and RPA framework: An opportunity to create cross-platform integration tests, be it web-based, or on the level of an operating system. 

Areas of expertise and consulting products, such as these, are invented and supported like internal start-ups by using lean methods. 
Employees contribute their topics of interest as part of our research and development activities. Right now, this is happening with IT Security, [Cloud Architecture](https://www.viadee.de/cloud), Process Mining, Agile Leadership, ML Ops, and several other topics.

## WHAT WE DO ON GITHUB
Our R&D community and our students working on their thesis projects regularly publish their results in open source repositories here.   
You will also find companion repositories for conference talks, online seminars etc.
